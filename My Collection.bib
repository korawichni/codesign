abstract = {This study deepens on the transient response analysis of the so-called vector proportional–integral (VPI) controllers and compares them with the popular proportional–resonant (PR) controllers for grid-connected applications. The employed methodology is based on the study of the error signal roots: both reference tracking and disturbance rejection abilities are considered for proper gain tuning. This study proves that PR controllers lead to shorter settling times than VPI controllers. A three-phase voltage source converter prototype has been implemented. Experimental results comparing the transient behaviour of VPI and PR controllers in different conditions are provided: a + 90° phase-angle jump in the current reference and a ‘type C' voltage sag at the point of common coupling.},

abstract = {As a finishing touch for “switches and converters” we study a few typical applications of power electronics such as UPS (uninterruptable power supply), PFC (power factor correction), high frequency (RF) inductive heating, lighting, wind turbines, photovoltaic solar panels, drive technology, motion control, high frequency induction cooking plate. For the UPS we consider as most important the static types with or without auxiliary network. The principle of RF inductive heating is explained with the minimum frequency related to the diameter of the work piece. Concerning the explanation of the PFC we made a choice for a boost converter with PFC. Lighting is with fluorescent lamps (with electronic ballast) or with LED. We tell the history of wind turbines and talk about wind and power and also about the power electric circuit (double fed induction generator, {\ldots}). The different methods of control are studied. For the photovoltaic solar panels we consider several block diagrams of energy transfer to a distribution network. Drive technology and motion control are treated in a few pages because the whole volume 2 of our textbook is concerned to drive technology and motion control.},

Furthermore, the effect of interleaving of several boost stages is analyzed as a measure for compactness increase. Finally, the selection of the appropriate switching frequency in order to achieve an overall optimized system is discussed. In this way, the design of the crucial components is carried out, namely, the boost inductor, including a volume optimization through a thermal connection to the heat sink; the output capacitor considering the rms current stress; and the input filter, which is designed for compliance with high-frequency electromagnetic compatibility standards, taking into account the quasi-peak detection measurement of the test receiver equipment.},

In order to design PWM methods, the influence of PWM methods on the current ripple is needed. This paper studies the current ripple of a three-phase PWM converter with general PWM methods for the design and control of this kind of converter. The current ripple is analyzed with eight different Thevenin equivalent circuits for the eight different voltage vectors. Then, the current-ripple slope and effective time could be achieved for every period. The current ripple could be predicted with both peak and rms values. Analytical predicted results show that discontinuous PWM could generate obviously bigger current ripples than space vector PMW for both peak and rms values with the same conditions. Simulation and experiments are built to verify the analytical results, proving that the theoretical prediction is valid. This analysis provides the basis for the design and control of the PWM method for converters.},

abstract = {In this paper, the filter performance of a wide-bandgap (WBG) three phase motor inverter with integrated sinusoidal output voltage LC filter is analyzed. To ensure a well damped system behaviour at low losses, an active damping scheme based on filter capacitor feedback is used. Unfortunately, the nonlinear DC-Bias dependent capacitance of the used ceramic capacitors (X7R is used to minimize filter volume) significantly affects the active damping. A symmetrical filter structure sufficiently reduces the capacitors voltage dependency. However, the paper shows that the symmetrical structure also causes negative effects in respective to the filters noise suppression performance. Modifications in the filter topology are reported and analyzed for reducing the impaired noise suppression. The proposed filter scheme finally results in a well damped system behaviour fulfilling established EMC standards according output noise demonstrated by experimental results of a 2 kW/400 V laboratory prototype.},

For the foreseen adoption of EVs, it is not only important to study the technology behind it, but also the environment it will be inserted into. In Europe, temperatures ranging from −30 °C to +40 °C are frequently observed and the impacts on batteries are well-known. However, the impact on the grid due to the performance of fast-chargers, under such conditions, also requires analysis, as it impacts both on the infrastructure's dimensioning and design. In this study, six different fast-chargers were analysed while charging a full battery EV, under four temperature levels (−25 °C, −15 °C, +20 °C, and +40 °C). The current total harmonic distortion, power factor, standby power, and unbalance were registered. Results show that the current total harmonic distortion (THDI) tended to increase at lower temperatures. The standby consumption showed no trend, with results ranging from 210 VA to 1650 VA. Three out of six chargers lost interoperability at −25 °C. Such non-linear loads, present high harmonic distortion, and, hence, low power factor. The temperature at which the vehicle's battery charges is crucial to the current it withdraws, thereby, influencing the charger's performance.},

It presents a novel way of deriving equations for the spectrum of double-edge PWM using basic mathematical techniques. In the process the underlying nonlinearities that generate the PWM sidebands are identified. Unlike the classical double Fourier series approach, the proposed method of deriving the PWM spectrum does not require the construction of the so-called unit cell. The interaction between this new model of the pulse-width modulator and the regular sampling process is studied, and generalized equations for the Fourier transforms of regularly sampled PWM waveforms are derived. A general solution to the important question of what happens to the PWM spectrum when the PWM reference consists of a summation of signals is presented. It is shown that the addition of reference signals in the time domain results in a double convolution of the PWM sidebands in the frequency domain. As an application of this result, it is shown how new analytic equations for the harmonics of third-harmonic injection PWM and space vector modulation can easily be derived. Finally, the new theoretical results are benchmarked against results from the well-established double Fourier series method.},

By using elementary methods, the pulse-width-modulated waveform is written as the sum of two sawtooth functions and the original modulating waveform. Simply applying the well-known Fourier series expansion of the sawtooth function, an equivalent model of the pulse width modulator, which shows that it is in essence a sequence of phase modulators, is derived. This model provides a clear understanding of the nonlinearities involved in the PWM process. It is shown how the superposition of modulating waveforms in the time-domain translates into the convolution of the sidebands in the frequency domain. Finally, the interaction of the pulse width modulator and a sample-and-hold register is studied and a general expression for the Fourier transform of a regular-sampled PWM waveform is derived.

In particular, active power control will play an important role both during grid faults (low-voltage ride-through capability and controlled current injection) and in normal conditions (reserve function and frequency regulation). The aim of this paper is to propose a flexible active power control based on a fast current controller and a reconfigurable reference current selector. Several strategies to select the current reference are studied and compared using experimental results that are obtained during an unsymmetrical voltage fault. The results of the analysis allow selection of the best reference current in every condition.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper has presented a stability analysis of a LCL-type grid-connected inverter in the discrete-time domain. It has been found that even though the system is stable when the resonance frequency f,. is higher than one-sixth of the sampling frequency (f8/6), an effective damping scheme is still required due to the potential influence of the grid impedance. With a conventional proportional capacitor-current-feedback active damping (AD), the valid damping region is only up to f8/6. This however is not sufficient in the design process for obtaining a high quality output current and the system can easily become unstable due to the resonance frequency shifting. Considering the resonance frequency design rules of the LCL filter, this paper proposes an improved capacitor-current-feedback AD method. With a detailed analysis and proper parameter design, the upper limit of the damping region is extended to f8/4, which can cover all the possible resonance frequencies. Then, the damping performance of the proposed AD method is studied. It shows that the optimal damping is obtained when the actual resonance frequency is (fr + f8/4)/2. Moreover, an approximate calculation for the optimal damping coefficient R is given. Finally, the experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed AD method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE. Grid-connected converters (GcCs) employ LCL filters instead of simple L filters in order to meet new grid codes and their on-going changes in the near future. Active damping methods, without power losses, are preferred to passive ones for solving the resonance problems of LCL-filter-based GcCs ( LCL-GcCs). However, large changes in the grid inductance (typically under weak grid conditions and in rural areas) may compromise the system stability. Moreover, the delay of digital controllers will change system phase-frequency characteristics and consequently will affect the system stability. In view of this, this paper proposes a systematic design procedure for the active damping of voltage-oriented PI control for LCL-GcCs. The procedure considers active damping methods based on capacitor current feedback and is aimed to ensure stable operation under severe grid inductance variations while taking into account the influence of digital control delay and LCL filter parameters changes on the system stability. Simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed in order to validate the proposed design procedure.},

abstract = {Pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage source converters are becoming a popular interface to the power grid for many applications. Hence, issues related to the reduction of PWM harmonics injection in the power grid are becoming more relevant. The use of high-order filters like LCL filters is a standard solution to provide the proper attenuation of PWM carrier and sideband voltage harmonics. However, those grid filters introduce potentially unstable dynamics that should be properly damped either passively or actively. The second solution suffers from control and system complexity (a high number of sensors and a high-order controller), even if it is more attractive due to the absence of losses in the damping resistors and due to its flexibility. An interesting and straightforward active damping solution consists in plugging in, in cascade to the main controller, a filter that should damp the unstable dynamics. No more sensors are needed, but there are open issues such as preserving the bandwidth, robustness, and limited complexity. This paper provides a systematic approach to the design of filter-based active damping methods. The tuning procedures, performance, robustness, and limitations of the different solutions are discussed with theoretical analysis, selected simulation, and experimental results.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robust model-based active damping control in natural frame for a three-phase voltage source inverter with LCL filter. The presence of the LCL filter complicates the design of the control scheme, particularly when system parameters deviation is considered. The proposed control method is addressed to overcome such difficulties and uses a modified converter model in a state observer. In this proposal, the converter model is modified by introducing a virtual damping resistor. Then, a Kalman filter makes use of this model to estimate the system state-space variables. Although the state estimates do not obviously match the real world system variables, they permit designing three-current sliding-mode controllers that provide the following features to the closed loop system: 1) robust and active damping capability like in the case of using a physical damping resistor; 2) robustness because the control specifications are met independently of variation in the system parameters; 3) noise immunity due to the application of the Kalman filter; and 4) power loss minimization because the system losses caused by the physical damping resistor are avoided. An interesting side effect of the proposed control scheme is that the sliding surfaces for each controller are independent. This decoupling property for the three controllers allows using a fixed switching frequency algorithm that ensures perfect current control. To complete the control scheme, a theoretical stability analysis is developed. Finally, selected experimental results validate the proposed control strategy and permit illustrating all its appealing features. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Due to multifeedback of state variables, a discrete state-space controller offers outstanding control bandwidth as well as control stability for popular LCL-type grid-connected inverters, while the grid current is still vulnerable to the grid-voltage harmonics. The feedforward of grid voltage, usually employed in continuous controllers to solve such a problem, is too complicated to be applied for the discrete state-space controller. By means of continuous transformation, a full grid-voltage feedforward (GVFF) decoupling strategy is successfully proposed in this paper to make the feedforward possible for the discrete state-space controller. Based on the transfer function analysis and comparison of discretized and continuous system, comprehensive verification is also provided to verify the effectiveness of the derivation of the GVFF path. Subsequently, the robustness analysis of the proposed strategy to the grid impedance is also performed. Moreover, a grid-voltage estimator instead of the measured voltage is employed for the full GVFF, which not only retains the important information of grid voltage but also eliminates the influence of accompanied noises. The distinct features of the proposed feedforward controller plus implementation strategy are the super steady waveform, dynamic response, and robustness to the variation of grid impedance. Besides, the complexity of the algorithm is moderate and the computational burden is not significantly increased. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed strategy.},

This lecture is inspired on [1, Chapter 9]. 9.1 An optimization problem Suppose a farmer has 75 acres to plant and must decide how much farm land to devote to crop x or crop y. Crop x brings in more revenue than y, as can be seen from the profit function P (x, y): P (x, y) = 143x + 60y. In maximizing the profit P (x, y), all should be devoted to crop x, but farming is not that simple. There are additional constraints (other than x + y ≤ 75). For instance, crop x requires more storage space than crop y, and if the total storage is limited to 4,000, then we have to take the following constraint 110x + 30y ≤ 4, 000 into account. The crops just do not grow for free. As the farmer cannot spend more than 15,000 to grow the crops, the third constraint takes the form 120x + 210y ≤ 15, 000. In addition to the trivial constraints x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, our problem is summarized into: max x,y 143x + 60y subject to        x + y ≤ 75 110x + 30y ≤ 4, 000 120x + 210y ≤ 15, 000 x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 Since there are only two unknowns involved, we may graph all constraints: >> x = 0:80; % range for graph >> y1 = max(75 -x,0); % x + y <= 75 farm land >> y2 = max((4000-110*x)/30,0); % 110x + 30y <= 4000 storage >> y3 = max((15000 -120*x)/210,0); % 120x + 210y <= 15000 expenses >> ytop = min([y1; y2; y3]); % array of minima >> area(x,ytop); % filled area plot The shaded area enclosed by the constraints is called the feasible region, which is the set of points satisfying all the constraints. If this region is empty, then the problem is said to be infeasible, and it has no solution. The lines of equal profit p are given by p = 143x + 60y. If we fix p to, say 50, then all points (x, y) which satisfy 143x + 60y yield the same profit 50. >> hold on; >> [u v] = meshgrid(0:80, 0:80); >> contour(u,v,143*u + 60*v); >> hold off; To find the optimal solution, we look at the lines of equal profit to find the corner of the feasible region which yields the highest profit. This corner can be found at the farthest line of equal profit which still touches the feasible region.},

In single-phase inverters, the unipolar pulse-width modulation (UP-PWM) method is commonly used. However, this method has the disadvantage of power losses due to numerous switching operations. Conventional DPWM methods reduce the power losses and improve efficiency but increase the current total harmonic distortion (THD). To overcome these weaknesses, this paper proposes a hybrid DPWM switching method combining two PWM methods: the UP-PWM method and the conventional DPWM method called one-pole clamped PWM method. Since the proposed DPWM method offers all the advantages of both PWM methods, the optimal performance-with regard to the power losses and current THD-is obtained. The combination of the two PWM methods is investigated by analyzing the power losses and current THD. Based on the analysis, the process how to determine the optimal operating condition is introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed DPWM method is demonstrated through simulations and experiments.

As a foundation for unification, the general form of the modulation functions for matrix converters is derived using geometric transformation approach. All eligible direct modulation matrices are shown to be of indirect form and are expressed in terms of instantaneous phase quantities. This paper also presents a new viewpoint to consider a matrix converter as a generalized three-level inverter and to apply the double-carrier-based dipolar modulation technique of the three-level inverter to the matrix converter.

abstract = {Innovation in its whole definition is a way for industrial groups to preserve and create value over competitors on the market. Mainly technologic, innovation is also of use, a new way of using a product or service to answer market or user requirements. This work is an innovation for component design in power electronic systems, both in tools and user customs.Power electronic is subject to same research goals as any modern system, i.e. cost and time to market reduction, efficiency increase in the global energy save world concern and modularity of solution to answer maximum customer needs. Among the multitude of proposed solutions during the last decade, multi-legs and multi-levels converters, new SiC and GaN semiconductors or new control strategies, the choice is cornelian for the designer. The need of tool to help designers in their choices is clearly identified in industry. To answer this problem, this work proposes the implementation of passive component sizing using discrete optimization methods. The choice of accuracy and industrial constraints is done to get already purchasable solution from optimization results to suppliers.In the first part of the PhD dissertation the main optimization algorithms are introduced with the optimization strategies. G2Elab experience and Schneider electric one lead to privileged discrete optimization using stochastic algorithms and libraries of components and materials. In the second part the models for passive components are developed to match stochastic algorithms requirements. Focus is done on magnetics because their sizing is dominant compare to capacitor. The effort is done on losses computation and magnetic behavior of powder alloy and amorphous materials widely used in Schneider Electric applications. With these low loss density materials, the gain on efficiency is achieved on conductors. Thus a new semi-analytic model is developed to overcome standard models issues and to compete with integral or finite element method in terms of accuracy and overcoming them in terms of calculation speed.In the third part, filter modeling approach is introduced for AC/DC, DC/AC and DC/DC converters. This modeling takes into account all working cases of UPS impacting passive components design. Interleaved and coupled solutions are investigated.Finally some examples of developed applications for Schneider Electric are presented. The sizing of passive component using discrete optimization methods are implemented with success. Measures are achieved on prototypes to validate our approach.},

abstract = {A key topic in classical control theory is the Internal Model Principle (IMP). A particular case of the IMP for tracking periodic references or attenuating periodic disturbances in closed-loop control systems is a technique called repetitive control. This work proposes and describes an educational laboratory plant to show the students the advantages of repetitive controllers in systems with periodic references or disturbances. The plant has been designed to be low cost, easy to build, and subject to periodic disturbances with a clear physical explanation. More specifically, it consists of a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) electronic amplifier, a small dc motor, and a magnetic setup that generates a periodic load torque under constant mechanical speed operation. The control objective for the closed-loop control system is to regulate the mechanical speed to a constant value in spite of the periodic load torque disturbance. In order to accomplish this performance specification, a detailed design of a digital repetitive controller is presented, and some basic experimental results are provided to prove its good behavior. The paper also includes some repetitive control concepts and facts that teaching experience shows as essential to understand the design process.},

The analysis and design of PR controllers is usually performed by Bode diagrams and phase-margin criterion. However, this approach presents some limitations when resonant frequencies are higher than the crossover frequency defined by the proportional gain. This condition occurs in selective harmonic control and applications with high reference frequency with respect to the switching frequency, e.g., high-power converters with a low switching frequency. In such cases, additional 0-dB crossings (phase margins) appear; therefore, the usual methods for simple systems are no longer valid. In addition, VPI controllers always present multiple 0-dB crossings in their frequency response. In this paper, the proximity to the instability of PR and VPI controllers is evaluated and optimized through Nyquist diagrams. A systematic method is proposed to obtain the highest stability and avoidance of closed-loop anomalous peaks: it is achieved by the minimization of the inverse of the Nyquist trajectory distance to the critical point, i.e., the sensitivity function. Finally, several experimental tests, including an active power filter that operates at a low switching frequency and compensates harmonics up to the Nyquist frequency, validate the theoretical approach.},

Generally speaking, the current regulator guarantees the quality of the injected grid current, and the active damping suppresses the resonance peak caused by the LCL filter and makes it easier to stabilize the whole system. Based on the proportional-integral (PI) and proportional-resonant (PR) compensator together with capacitor-current-feedback active-damping which are widely used for their effectiveness and simple implementations, this paper proposes a simple step-by-step controller design method for the LCL-type grid-connected inverter. By carefully dealing with the interaction between the current regulator and active damping, the complete satisfactory regions of the controller parameters for meeting the system specifications are obtained, and from which the controller parameters can be easily picked out. Based on these satisfactory regions, it is more convenient and explicit to optimize the system performance. Besides, the insight of tuning the controller parameters from these satisfactory regions is also discussed. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed step-by-step design method.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the capacitor-current-feedback active damping for the digitally controlled LCL-type grid-connected inverter. It turns out that proportional feedback of the capacitor current is equivalent to virtual impedance connected in parallel with the filter capacitor due to the computation and pulse width modulation (PWM) delays. The LCL-filter resonance frequency is changed by this virtual impedance. If the actual resonance frequency is higher than one-sixth of the sampling frequency (fs/6), where the virtual impedance contains a negative resistor component, a pair of open-loop unstable poles will be generated. As a result, the LCL-type grid-connected inverter becomes much easier to be unstable if the resonance frequency is moved closer to fs/6 due to the variation of grid impedance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a capacitor-current-feedback active damping with reduced computation delay, which is achieved by shifting the capacitor current sampling instant towards the PWM reference update instant. With this method, the virtual impedance exhibits more like a resistor in a wider frequency range, and the open-loop unstable poles are removed; thus, high robustness against the grid-impedance variation is acquired. Experimental results from a 6-kW prototype confirm the theoretical expectations.},

Comparisons between the proposed controller and a discretized full-state-feedback continuous-time-derived controller are made and show significant improvements in both BW and stability margins.

abstract = {Due to the effect of the computation and modulation delays on the capacitor-current-feedback active damping, the digitally controlled LCL-filtered inverter tends to be unstable as the LCL-filter resonance frequency approaching to one-sixth of the sampling frequency. Therefore, to guarantee sufficient stability margins, the guideline for choosing the LCL-filter resonance frequency is proposed in this paper. After the resonance frequency is selected, a systematic design method is proposed to facilitate the selection of the proper controller parameters. With this design method, a satisfactory region of the controller parameters for meeting the system specifications is obtained, from which the proper controller parameters can be easily determined. Moreover, it is convenient and explicit to optimize the system performance according to the satisfactory region. A 6-kW prototype is built and tested. The simulation and experimental results validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {An LCL-type filter is widely used in the grid-connected inverter. However, with only injected grid current control, the current harmonics and low bandwidth caused by the resonance peak cannot be tolerated. The active damping (AD) method with an extra feedback provides a high rejection of the resonance so that the dynamic is improved; however, the high-precision sensing circuit for the extra feedback increases the cost. In this paper, with the signal flow graph and response-fitting methods, an AD method based on the feedback of the injected grid current has been proposed. Then, the novel closed-loop current control requires accurately sensing the injected grid current only, while no observation is needed. Compared with the extra feedback methods, the cost and the complexity are reduced while the reliability is improved. Based on the study of the relation between the controller and the system dynamic, a straightforward design has been proposed. The robustness, harmonic rejection, and digital implementation have been studied. Compared with the conventional control methods, the proposed one promises the satisfactory performance with both analog and digital implementations. Simulations and experiments have verified the proposed control and design strategies.},

This paper presents an analytical design methodology for litz-wired HF power transformers that provides a deep insight into the transformer design problem making it a powerful tool for converter designers. The most suitable models for the calculation of core and winding losses and the transformer thermal resistance are first selected and then validated with a 5-kW 50-kHz commercial transformer for a photovoltaic application. Based on these models, the design methodology is finally proposed, reducing the design issue to directly solve a five-variable nonlinear optimization problem. The methodology is illustrated with a detailed design in terms of magnetic material, core geometry, and primary and secondary litz-wire sizing. The optimal design achieves a 46.5% power density increase and a higher efficiency of 99.70% when compared with the commercial one.},

The impact of model inaccuracies and numerical errors on the dynamic and stability of the system is investigated. It is shown that the repetitive controller leads to low damping or even instability at high switching frequencies caused by modeling errors or numerical inaccuracies. Based on the stability analysis it is discussed how to handle these design challenges which exist especially for repetitive controllers of high order.

This way doing, the algorithm is able to tackle the problem of over-parametrization (i.e., when the internal model accounts for a number of sinusoids that is larger than the true spectral content) or temporarily fading sinusoidal components. The stability analysis proves the existence of a tuning parameter set for which the estimator's dynamics are input-to-state stable with respect to bounded measurement disturbances.

abstract = {The grid voltage, especially under unbalanced and harmonically distorted grid conditions, often distorts the injected currents of grid-connected inverters. To address this problem, a robust control scheme of grid-connected inverters is presented in this paper. The proposed scheme is achieved by an internal model (IM)-based current controller and a robust phase-locked loop (PLL) scheme. The robust PLL scheme employs open-loop filtering technique to offer exact steady-state performance as well as fast transient response. The IM-based current controller is stabilized using the linear matrix inequality approach to optimize the feedback gains, and implemented in the synchronous reference frame to reduce computational efforts. A state estimator is also introduced into current controller for the purpose of reducing the number of current sensors, which are often required in state feedback controller to damp the unstable dynamics of LCL filters. The validity of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through comparative simulations and experimental results using a prototype grid-connected inverter.},

abstract = {IEEE LCL filters feature low inductance; thus, the injected grid current from an LCL-filtered Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) can be easily distorted by grid voltage harmonics. This problem is especially tough for the control system with Inverter-side Current Feedback (ICF), since the grid current harmonics can freely flow into the filter capacitor. In this case, because of the loss of harmonic information, traditional harmonic controllers fail to mitigate the grid current distortion. Although this problem may be avoided using the grid voltage feedforward scheme, the required second-order differentiator may cause noise amplification. In light of the above issue, this paper develops a simple method for the ICF control system to mitigate the grid current harmonics without extra sensors. In the proposed method, harmonic controllers and a feedforward scheme are adopted at the same time, and potential instability introduced by the feedforward loop is avoided. This is achieved through a special design of the feedforward position, which maintains the inherent stability characteristic of the ICF control system. Additionally, the design of the LCL-filter and the current controller for the proposed scheme is discussed in this paper. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Carrier synchronization is a fundamental stage in the receiver side of any communication or positioning system. Traditional carrier phase tracking techniques are based on well-known phase-locked loop (PLL) closed-loop architectures, which are still the methods of choice in modern receivers. Those techniques are well understood, easy to tune, and perform well under benign propagation conditions, but their applicability is seriously compromised in harsh propagation environments, where the signal may be affected by high dynamics, shadowing, strong fadings, multipath effects, or ionospheric scintillation. From an optimal filtering standpoint, the Kalman filter (KF) is clearly a powerful alternative, but the synchronization community seems still reluctant to exploit all the potential it has to offer. The purpose of this article is twofold: i) to review the basics and state of the art on both PLL and KF-based tracking techniques and ii) to present and justify the reasoning behind the systematic use of KF-based tracking approaches instead of the well-established PLL-based architectures from both theoretical and practical points of view. To support the discussion, two specific scenarios of interest to the aerospace community are numerically evaluated: robust carrier tracking of global navigation satellite systems' signals and synchronization in a deep space communications system.},

abstract = {Peak torque and power density requirements for traction motor drives continue to increase, while demands on reliability are getting increasingly stringent as well. With the knowledge that most of the failure mechanisms are related to excessive temperature (cycling), thermal management is a key for increasing performance, without jeopardizing reliability. This paper proposes a control strategy for active thermal management of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives, based on real-time estimation and feedback of switching device and motor temperatures. By regulating the switching frequency and current control limit, critical components can be safeguarded from excessive temperature rise. Furthermore, optimal dq-current control vectors are calculated within the temperature and voltage constraints, to maximize the drive's efficiency and speed-torque envelope. Hence, the control strategy enables the drivetrain to operate safely at maximum attainable performance limits. The strategy is experimentally validated on an 11-kW PMSM drive for a number of representative vehicle loads, including a maximum standstill torque test, a maximum acceleration test, and a driving cycle test.},

This suggests that stress heterogeneity adjacent to active faults like the San Andreas may reflect variations in stresses and loading conditions along the fault.},

abstract = {Conventional resonant controllers (RCs) are commonly used in the current control of grid-tied converters with LCL filter due to their advantages, such as zero steady-state error at both fundamental sequences, easy design process, and straightforward implementation. Nevertheless, these traditional solutions do not permit to place the closed-loop poles of the system in convenient locations when dealing with a fourth-order plant model such as the LCL filter plus the computation delay. Therefore, the reference tracking and the disturbance rejection are deficient in terms of transient behavior and depend on the LCL filter. Furthermore, an additional active damping method usually has to be designed in order to ensure stability. This paper presents an enhanced current RC with stable and fast response, negligible overshoot, good disturbance rejection, and low controller effort for grid-tied converters with LCL filter. The developed solution uses a direct discrete-time pole-placement strategy from the classical control theory (using transfer functions), involving two extra filters, to enhance the performance of the RC. In this manner, the complexity of state-space methods from modern control theory is avoided. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract = {In EMC measurements spectra generated by pulsed signals are often measured. To calculate the spectra theoretically, Fourier methods are usually used. The Fourier transform yields a spectrum which contains positive and negative frequencies. The exponential form of the Fourier series also yields a spectrum which contains positive and negative frequencies. However, the trigonometric form of the Fourier series yields a spectrum containing only positive frequencies. Since there seems to be some doubt about the physical interpretation of negative frequencies, the relationship between the double sided spectrum of the exponential Fourier series and the single sided spectrum of the trigonometric Fourier series is shown. The reasoning is then extended to the Fourier transform to show the relationship between the double and single sided spectrum obtained by the Fourier transform. A method of obtaining spectral levels for positive frequencies only using the Fourier transform is shown.},

The output-tracking error is normalized by the size of the desired output and used as a measure of the output tracking performance. The worst-case performance is compared for two cases: (1) with the use of feedback alone and (2) with the addition of the feedforward input. It is shown that inversion-based feedforward controllers can lead to performance improvements at frequencies w where the uncertainty &Delta; (jw) in the nominal plant is smaller than the size of the nominal plant G0(jw) divided by its condition number KG0 (jw), i.e., ||&Delta;(jw)||2 0(jw) ||2/kG0 (jw). A modified feedforward input is proposed that only uses the model information in frequency regions where plant uncertainty is sufficiently small. The use of this modified inverse with (any) feedback results in improvement of the output tracking performance, when compared to the use of the feedback alone.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE. A main design constraint of the digitally controlled power electronics converters is the time delay of control systems, which may lead to the reduced control loop bandwidth and even unstable dynamics. Numerous time-delay compensation methods have been developed, of which the model-free schemes are independent to model accuracy whereas the model-based alternatives are sensitive to system modeling. This paper first presents a graphical illustration of four model-free delay compensation techniques, where their principles and performances are intuitively elaborated and compared by means of the impulse area equivalence method. An improved time-delay compensation approach is then proposed based on additional area insertion, which provides a wider frequency of phase compensation. Finally, the dynamic response of an LCL-filtered grid-connected inverter was tested with the studied delay compensation methods. Simulations and experimental test results validate the effectiveness of the graphical comparisons and the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Current regulation plays an important role in modern power electronic AC conversion systems. The most direct strategy to regulate such currents is to use a simple closed loop proportional-integral (PI) regulator, which has no theoretical stability limits as the proportional and integral gains are increased, since it is only a second order system. However, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) transport and controller sampling delays limit the gain values that can be achieved in practical systems. Taking these limitations into account, this paper presents an analytical method to determine the best possible gains that can be achieved for any class of practical linear AC current controller. The analysis shows that the maximum possible proportional gain is determined by the plant series inductance, the DC bus voltage and the transport and sampling delays, while the maximum possible integral gain is determined primarily by the transport and sampling delays. The work is applicable to stationary frame PI regulators, stationary frame controllers with back electromotive force compensation, stationary frame P+ resonant (PR) controllers, and synchronous <i>d</i>- <i>q</i> frame controllers, since they all have identical proportional and integral gains that must be optimized for any particular application.},

In addition, we extend the theory of performance factor for appropriate use in the HF design. Since magnetic materials suitable for HF applications tend to have low permeability, we also consider the impact of low permeability on design. We conclude that, with appropriate material selection and design, increased frequencies can continue to yield improved power density well into the HF regime.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple method to analyze the behavior of feedback loops that contain a naturally-sampled single-edge pulse-width modulator. A small-signal model is derived by means of simple geometric arguments. It is shown how this small-signal model can be used to analyze the stability of the continuous-time pulse-width modulated feedback loop by using standard z-domain techniques. The strategy relies on familiar concepts like transfer functions and small-signal gains and does not require any in-depth knowledge of nonlinear systems. A simple design process, where the continuous-time compensator is designed directly in the z-domain, is developed and detailed design equations are derived for a PI current regulator. It is shown how the proposed strategy can accurately predict instability that cannot be explained by means of the well-known average model of the pulse-width modulator. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by means of detailed time-domain simulations. The mechanisms that lead to instability are discussed and an equation for the critical loop gain is derived. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

The model allows a computationally efficient analysis on the core loss of the inductor under the square voltage excitation and the premagnetization condition. First, the core loss of the filter inductor under buck chopper excitation is evaluated with the proposed model and compared with the conventional methods. The comparison shows that the proposed method results in a better core loss prediction under the premagnetized condition than conventional alternatives. Then, the core loss of the filter inductor with the pulse width modulated inverter excitation is evaluated, which shows that the proposed model not only accurately predicts the core loss but identifies also the hysteresis loss part. These results demonstrate that the approach can further be used for the development of magnetic materials for power electronic applications. IEEE},

abstract = {A new approach for digital feedback control of a PWM inverter is proposed, in which an output DB (deadbeat) control is achieved combined with a disturbance observer. In the proposed scheme, the pole placements of the state observer and the disturbance observer are chosen separately. When the two observers employed the same pole placements, the experimental setup had a tendency to become unstable due to the detection error. By selection of the different pole placements, the disturbance observer quickly estimates the disturbance and feedforward disturbance cancellation is achieved. Then the state observer estimates the state variables at the next sampling instant, and the deadbeat controller is applied to the nominal system. This scheme has advantages in robustness in the practical application. From the view point of UPS applications, the advantages and disadvantages are discussed through simulations and experiments. Compared with other digital control laws, the superiority of the proposed control law is verified.},

@article{Afsari2017,
abstract = {—This paper introduces a large class of differential-geometric distances between finite-dimensional linear dynamical systems, collectively called the alignment distance. Contrary to the existing distances, the alignment distance is based on the state-space description of dynam-ical systems, and is defined on the manifolds of systems of fixed order and fixed input–output dimension under a matrix rank constraint (e.g., minimality, controllability, or observability). While the quotient topology and principal fiber bundle structure associated with such manifolds have been known since the early days of modern control theory, distances natural to this structure have not been studied. The starting point for defining such a distance is to identify a linear system of order n with its equivalence class of state-space realizations, all related by the so-called similar-ity action, i.e., state-space change of basis under GL(n), the Lie group of nonsingular n × n matrices. The main idea of the alignment distance is to first find the best state-space change of basis that brings a realization of a system " as close as possible " to a realization of another system (the alignment step), and then compare the aligned realizations. A direct implementation of this idea, due to noncompact-ness of GL(n), is complicated. However, using the notion of " reduction of the structure group " of a principal bundle, we show that the change of basis can be restricted to an orthogonal change of basis, provided one uses realizations in a reduced subbundle. This key observation brings about significant computational benefits. As a technical contribu-tion (possibly of independent interest), we show that several forms of realization balancing available in the control liter-ature have differential-geometric significance, and are, in-deed, examples of reducing the structure group from GL(n) to its subgroup of orthogonal matrices O(n). The alignment distance can be defined for stable and unstable systems, discrete or continuous-time, and stochastic systems.},

It was demonstrated that the mathematical formulation and the splitting of the problem into subproblems are essential factors in the conditioning of these problems. It was also shown that standard approaches implemented in numerical toolboxes, which present widely accepted approaches in numerical control, may face problems due to ill conditioning. Some of these problems can be avoided by reformulating the problem, but several open problems remain. To assess the accuracy of calculations and to trust numerical results, such condition and accuracy estimates should accompany computational procedures and must be included in the corresponding computer codes. Users must be aware of possible difficulties accompanying the computational process and know how to avoid them. The issues should also become an essential part of the curriculum for scientist and engineers in learning how to use and develop modern computational software.},

abstract = {High-frequency current harmonics injected into the point of common coupling, mainly at the switching frequency and its multiples introduced by the modulation of grid-connected converters, should be limited to comply with grid codes. This requirement can be satisfied by using trap filters with LC-traps tuned at the switching frequency and its multiples in replacement of conventional L filters. However, all existing trap filters are subject to certain problems, e.g., sensitivity to grid impedance variation and decreased high-frequency roll-off rate. In view of this, this paper presents a trap-LCL filter with its parallel resonant LC-trap located on the converter side, named as LT-C-L filter. The modeling and analysis presented in this paper show that the LT-C-L filter can be the most promising trap filter due to its advantages such as high roll-off rate, robustness against parametric variations of grid impedance and passive damper, satisfactory harmonic attenuation at the switching frequency, reduction of converter current total-harmonic-distortion, and flexible design of filter components through magnetic integration. A single-phase ac/dc grid-connected converter prototype has been built and tested in the laboratory, and experimental results are presented to verify the superiority of the proposed filter.},

Recent results by Mehrmann and Xu show how this sensi-tivity depends on the location of the poles. In many applications it suffices to prescribe a set K in the complex plane that contains the poles. Mehrmann and Xu formulated a minimization problem for allocating the poles in a given set K so that the sensitivity to perturbations is reduced.

@article{Casson2011,
abstract = {Ultra low power circuits require robust and reliable operation despite the unavoidable use of low currents and the weak inversion transistor operation region. For analogue domain filtering doubly terminated LC ladder based filter topologies are thus highly desirable as they have very low sensitivities to component values: non-exact component values have a minimal effect on the realised transfer function. However, not all transfer functions are suitable for implementation via a LC ladder prototype, and even when the transfer function is suitable the synthesis procedure is not trivial. The modern circuit designer can thus benefit from an updated treatment of this synthesis procedure. This paper presents a methodology for the design of doubly terminated LC ladder structures making use of the symbolic maths engines in programs such as MATLAB and MAPLE. The methodology is explained through the detailed synthesis of an example 7th order bandpass filter transfer function for use in electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis.},

abstract = {A new dead time compensation method for a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) inverter is proposed. In the PWM inverter, voltage distortion due to the dead time effects produces fifth and seventh harmonics in the phase currents of the stationary reference frame, and a sixth harmonic in the <i>d</i>- and <i>q</i>-axis currents of the synchronous reference frame, respectively. In this paper, the sixth harmonic of the integrator output of the synchronous <i>d</i>-axis proportional-integral (PI) current regulator is used to compensate the output voltage distortion due to the dead time effects, since the integrator output has ripple corresponding to six times the stator fundamental frequency. The proposed method can be easily implemented by feedforwardly adding compensation voltages to the output reference voltage of the synchronous PI current regulator. The proposed method, therefore, has some significant advantages such as simple implementation without additional hardware, easy mathematical computation, no offline experimental measurements, and application in both the steady state and the transient state. The validity of the proposed compensation algorithm is shown through several experiments.},

@book{Astrom2008,
abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the basic principles and tools for the design and analysis of feedback systems. It is intended to serve a diverse audience of scientists and engineers who are interested in understanding and utilizing feedback in physical, biological, information and social systems.We have attempted to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum while being careful not to sacrifice rigor in the process. We have also attempted to make use of examples from a variety of disciplines, illustrating the generality of many of the tools while at the same time showing how they can be applied in specific application domains. A major goal of this book is to present a concise and insightful view of the current knowledge in feedback and control systems. The field of control started by teaching everything that was known at the time and, as new knowledge was acquired, additional courses were developed to cover new techniques. A consequence of this evolution is that introductory courses have remained the same for many years, and it is often necessary to take many individual courses in order to obtain a good perspective on the field. In developing this book, we have attempted to condense the current knowledge by emphasizing fundamental concepts. We believe that it is important to understand why feedback is useful, to know the language and basic mathematics of control and to grasp the key paradigms that have been developed over the past half century. It is also important to be able to solve simple feedback problems using back-of-the-envelope techniques, to recognize fundamental limitations and difficult control problems and to have a feel for available design methods. This book was originally developed for use in an experimental course at Caltech involving students from a wide set of backgrounds. The course was offered to undergraduates at the junior and senior levels in traditional engineering disciplines, as well as first- and second-year graduate students in engineering and science. This latter group included graduate students in biology, computer science and physics. Over the course of several years, the text has been classroom tested at Caltech and at Lund University, and the feedback from many students and colleagues has been incorporated to help improve the readability and accessibility of the material. Because of its intended audience, this book is organized in a slightly unusual fashion compared to many other books on feedback and control. In particular, we introduce a number of concepts in the text that are normally reserved for second-year courses on control and hence often not available to students who are not control systems majors. This has been done at the expense of certain traditional topics, which we felt that the astute student could learn independently and are often explored through the exercises. Examples of topics that we have included are nonlinear dynamics, Lyapunov stability analysis, the matrix exponential, reachability and observability, and fundamental limits of performance and robustness. Topics that we have deemphasized include root locus techniques, lead/lag compensation and detailed rules for generating Bode and Nyquist plots by hand. Several features of the book are designed to facilitate its dual function as a basic engineering text and as an introduction for researchers in natural, information and social sciences. The bulk of the material is intended to be used regardless of the audience and covers the core principles and tools in the analysis and design of feedback systems. Advanced sections, marked by the {\^{a}}€{\oe}dangerous bend{\^{a}}€� symbol shown here, contain material that requires a slightly more technical background, of the sort that would be expected of senior undergraduates in engineering. A few sections are marked by two dangerous bend symbols and are intended for readers with more specialized backgrounds, identified at the beginning of the section. To limit the length of the text, several standard results and extensions are given in the exercises, with appropriate hints toward their solutions. To further augment the printed material contained here, a companion web site has been developed and is available from the publisher{\^{a}}€™s web page: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8701.html The web site contains a database of frequently asked questions, supplemental examples and exercises, and lecture material for courses based on this text. The material is organized by chapter and includes a summary of the major points in the text as well as links to external resources. The web site also contains the source code for many examples in the book, as well as utilities to implement the techniques described in the text. Most of the code was originally written using MATLAB M-files but was also tested with LabView MathScript to ensure compatibility with both packages. Many files can also be run using other scripting languages such as Octave, SciLab, SysQuake and Xmath. The first half of the book focuses almost exclusively on state space control systems. We begin in Chapter 2 with a description of modeling of physical, biological and information systems using ordinary differential equations and difference equations. Chapter 3 presents a number of examples in some detail, primarily as a reference for problems that will be used throughout the text. Following this, Chapter 4 looks at the dynamic behavior of models, including definitions of stability and more complicated nonlinear behavior. We provide advanced sections in this chapter on Lyapunov stability analysis because we find that it is useful in a broad array of applications and is frequently a topic that is not introduced until later in one{\^{a}}€™s studies. The remaining three chapters of the first half of the book focus on linear systems, beginning with a description of input/output behavior in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we formally introduce feedback systems by demonstrating how state space control laws can be designed. This is followed in Chapter 7 by material on output feedback and estimators. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the key concepts of reachability and observability, which give tremendous insight into the choice of actuators and sensors, whether for engineered or natural systems. The second half of the book presents material that is often considered to be from the field of {\^{a}}€{\oe}classical control.{\^{a}}€� This includes the transfer function, introduced in Chapter 8, which is a fundamental tool for understanding feedback systems. Using transfer functions, one can begin to analyze the stability of feedback systems using frequency domain analysis, including the ability to reason about the closed loop behavior of a system from its open loop characteristics. This is the subject of Chapter 9, which revolves around the Nyquist stability criterion. In Chapters 10 and 11, we again look at the design problem, focusing first on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and then on the more general process of loop shaping. PID control is by far the most common design technique in control systems and a useful tool for any student. The chapter on frequency domain design introduces many of the ideas of modern control theory, including the sensitivity function. In Chapter 12, we combine the results from the second half of the book to analyze some of the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and performance. This is also a key chapter illustrating the power of the techniques that have been developed and serving as an introduction for more advanced studies. The book is designed for use in a 10- to 15-week course in feedback systems that provides many of the key concepts needed in a variety of disciplines. For a 10-week course, Chapters 1{\^{a}}€“2, 4{\^{a}}€“6 and 8{\^{a}}€“11 can each be covered in a week{\^{a}}€™s time, with the omission of some topics from the final chapters. A more leisurely course, spread out over 14{\^{a}}€“15 weeks, could cover the entire book, with 2 weeks on modeling (Chapters 2 and 3) {\^{a}}€” particularly for students without much background in ordinary differential equations {\^{a}}€” and 2 weeks on robust performance (Chapter 12). The mathematical prerequisites for the book are modest and in keeping with our goal of providing an introduction that serves a broad audience. We assume familiarity with the basic tools of linear algebra, including matrices, vectors and eigenvalues. These are typically covered in a sophomore-level course on the subject, and the textbooks by Apostol [10], Arnold [13] and Strang [187] can serve as good references. Similarly, we assume basic knowledge of differential equations, including the concepts of homogeneous and particular solutions for linear ordinary differential equations in one variable. Apostol [10] and Boyce and DiPrima [42] cover this material well. Finally, we also make use of complex numbers and functions and, in some of the advanced sections, more detailed concepts in complex variables that are typically covered in a junior-level engineering or physics course in mathematical methods. Apostol [9] or Stewart [186] can be used for the basic material, with Ahlfors [6], Marsden and Hoffman [146] or Saff and Snider [172] being good references for the more advanced material. We have chosen not to include appendices summarizing these various topics since there are a number of good books available. One additional choice that we felt was important was the decision not to rely on a knowledge of Laplace transforms in the book. While their use is by far the most common approach to teaching feedback systems in engineering, many students in the natural and information sciences may lack the necessary mathematical background. Since Laplace transforms are not required in any essential way, we have included them only in an advanced section intended to tie things together for students with that background. Of course, we make tremendous use of transfer functions, which we introduce through the notion of response to exponential inputs,},

The choice of topics, together with detailed end-of-chapter links to the bibliography, makes it an excellent research reference as well. The Second Edition constitutes a substantial revision and extension of the First Edition, mainly adding or expanding upon advanced material, including: Lie-algebraic accessibility theory, feedback linearization, controllability of neural networks, reachability under input constraints, topics in nonlinear feedback design (such as backstepping, damping, control-Lyapunov functions, and topological obstructions to stabilization), and introductions to the calculus of variations, the maximum principle, numerical optimal control, and linear time-optimal control. Also covered, as in the First Edition, are notions of systems and automata theory, and the algebraic theory of linear systems, including controllability, observability, feedback equivalence, and minimality; stability via Lyapunov, as well as input/output methods; linear-quadratic optimal control; observers and dynamic feedback; Kalman filtering via deterministic optimal observation; parametrization of stabilizing controllers, and facts about frequency domain such as the Nyquist criterion.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic effects have an important influence on all aspects of power electronic design. The effects of stray magnetic and electric fields on circuit performance, and the necessity to control the resulting stray inductance and capacitance by good circuit design practices are introduced. Inductors are key components and the pressure to design to meet high-frequency specifications is relentless. Four types of inductors are discussed briefly and their electromagnetic properties are compared and contrasted. High-frequency transformers are discussed in terms of their impact on circuit behavior and their major design issues. The limitations of conventional topologies at multimegahertz frequencies are explored. A circuit example of a half-bridge series-parallel resonant converter working between 1-2 MHz and implemented using hybrid technologies is used to demonstrate how circuit, component and layout design are electromagnetically interdependent},

abstract = {This paper presents a new fundamental approach to modal participation analysis of linear time-invariant systems, leading to new insights and new formulas for modal participation factors. Modal participation factors were introduced over a quarter century ago as a way of measuring the relative participation of modes in states, and of states in modes, for linear time-invariant systems. Participation factors have proved their usefulness in the field of electric power systems and in other applications. However, in the current understanding, it is routinely taken for granted that the measure of participation of modes in states is identical to that for participation of states in modes. Here, a new analysis using averaging over an uncertain set of system initial conditions yields the conclusion that these quantities should not be viewed as interchangeable. In fact, it is proposed that a new definition and calculation replace the existing ones for state in mode participation factors, while the previously existing participation factors definition and formula should be retained but viewed only as mode in state participation factors. Examples are used to illustrate the issues addressed and the results obtained.},

to tradeoffs in feedback systems, and how these can be aggravated by delays and unstable poles and zeros. Such results have been standard for decades using frequency
domain methods, which yield a rich variety of familiar
“waterbed” tradeoffs. While almost trivial for control
experts, frequency domain methods are less familiar to
many scientists and engineers who could benefit from the
insights such tradeoffs can provide. So here we present an
entirely time domain model using discrete time dynamics
and l1 norm performance. A simple waterbed effect is that
imposing zero steady state response to a step naturally
create oscillations that double the response to periodic disturbances. We also show how this tradeoff is further aggravated not only by unstable poles and zeros, but also delays, in a way clearer than in the frequency domain
versions.},

abstract = {Differential forms of various degrees go hand in hand with multiple integrals. They obviously constitute an essential tool in expressing the laws of physics. Some of their structures, however (exterior algebra, exterior differential operators, and others), are not widely known or used. This article concentrates on the relevance of the "exterior calculus" to electromagnetics. It is shown that the association of differential forms with electromagnetic quantities is quite natural. The basic relations between these quantities, displayed in flow diagrams, make use of a single operator "d" (exterior differential) in place of the familiar curl, grad and div operators of vector calculus. Their covariance properties (behavior under change of variables) are discussed. These formulas in space-time have a strikingly concise and elegant expression. Furthermore, they are also invariant under any change of coordinates involving both space and time. Physical dimensions of the electromagnetic forms are such that only two units (coulomb and weber, or e and g) are needed. A few sample applications of the exterior calculus are discussed, mostly to familiarize the reader with the aspect of equations written in this manner. The transition from differential to integral formulas is uniformly performed by means of Stokes' theorem (concisely expressed in terms of forms). When integrations over moving domains are involved, the concepts of flow and Lie derivative come into play. The relation of the topology of a region to the existence of potentials valid in that region is illustrated by two examples: the magnetic field due to a steady electric current and the vector potential of the B-field due to a Dirac magnetic monopole. An extensive appendix reviews most results needed in the main text.},

Depending on the inner structure of these wires, the frequency dependent losses differ extremely. Until now simulations have not sufficiently matched experimental measurements. The usual simulation approach has been to assume the initial current values in all strands in the litz wire to be the same. In this paper, a 3-D simulation of the connector allows the determination of the current values depending on the position of the strands in the wire. This current distribution is transferred to a 2-D rotationally symmetric simulation of the system (windings, coils, etc.). The current values are permuted between different strands to simulate the twisting of strands inside the litz wire. With this new method a very good agreement with measured losses was achieved and demonstrates how simulation allows one to improve the performance of litz wires.},

abstract = {Of the three basic passive components�resistors, capacitors, and inductors�inductors\nare the least ideal and, therefore, the most difficult to model.\nThe importance of a good model is that it not only tells you which\ninductor is best for your application, it also tells you how that\ninductor will behave in your application. Since early in the last\ncentury, engineers have recognized the effect of distributed capacitance\nwithin an inductor and the resulting self-resonant frequency. The\nresulting simple model of a single shunt capacitance across a lossy\ninductor is therefore nearly 90 years old.

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to the analysis of switched mode power converters utilizing coupled inductors and presents a novel canonical circuit model for N-winding coupled inductors. Waveform and ripple of the winding current in a coupled inductor converter can be easily determined using the developed model similar to those obtained in an uncoupled inductor converter. Influence of coupling coefficient on converter steady state and transient performance is readily predicted by the proposed model. It is found that in an N-phase coupled inductor converter, the voltage waveforms driving the leakage inductors are no longer the phase node voltages but are the modified voltages with a frequency N times the original switching frequency. In addition, their magnitudes also vary with the coupling coefficient among the coupled windings. Through coupling, a converter is capable of responding faster to load transient depending on the coupling coefficient and control mechanism, and that dependency is analytically revealed in the paper. Finally, a two-phase buck regulator is experimentally tested to verify the proposed model.},

The charge simulation method is used for finding the capacitances between turns and from turns to ground. The new methods are very efficient compared with the use of the technique of finite elements and are also remarkably accurate. Thus, the short circuit (or test) leakage inductance can be obtained from turn-to-turn information. Examples of calculated parameters are given for illustration. For validation, the results are compared with the parameters obtained using finite elements and tests. The elementary parameters can be used to create reduced-order computational models for the calculation of transient phenomena},

abstract = {A lumped circuit model is derived for a winding in a multiwinding transformer. The model is intended to be used in transformer models for circuit simulation using electrical-network simulators. A hybrid (partly electrical, partly magnetic) modeling approach is adopted in which magnetic components are described using the capacitance-permeance analogy instead of the widespread resistance-reluctance analogy. The network correctly models energy storage and power dissipation due to DC series wire resistance and to eddy current losses, independent of the way of excitation of the winding (electrical and/or magnetic). All component values are frequency independent and are parameterized by geometrical parameters, winding data and material parameters. The mathematical continued-fraction approximation technique is applied to derive approximating circuits to model eddy current losses. A fourth-order circuit shows acceptably small errors up to a frequency of about a factor of 1500 above the frequency at which eddy-current losses become apparent. The model is applied in a six-layer two-winding transformer model. Calculations both in the frequency domain and in the time domain show good agreement with measurements},

abstract = {A complete, three phase transformer model for the calculation of electromagnetic transients is presented. The model consists of a set of state equations solved with the trapezoidal rule of integration in order to obtain an equivalent Norton circuit at the transformer terminals. Thus the transformer model can be easily interfaced with an electromagnetic transients program. Its main features are: (a) the basic elements for the winding model are the turns; (b) the complete model includes the losses due to eddy currents in the windings and in the iron core; and (c) the solution of the state equations is obtained in decoupled iterations. For validation, the frequency response of the model is compared with tests on several transformers. Applications to the calculation of transients are given for illustration},

abstract = {When making calculations on a circuit, containing both electric impedances and transformers, it is frequently desirable to consider the transformers removed and the constraints they impose replaced by a rearrangement of the impedances connected to their terminals. Such "equivalent circuits" may not always be found; the rules are here established for their formation, and also for checking, by inspection, whether the transformer constraints are removable in this way, in any particular case. It is shown that the equivalent electric circuit of a transformer, having any arrangement of magnetic paths, is derivable from its magnetic circuit by application of the topological principle of duality. This cannot be done if the magnetic circuit is non-planar, as in the case of a transformer possessing four or more windings with leakage couplings; a physically realizable circuit does not then exist. Under certain conditions the principle may be applied in reverse and the impedances in a given electric circuit may be coupled together by a suitable transformer, so that the various current and voltage constraints are unaltered.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new equivalent circuit for the leakage inductance of multiwinding (or multisection) transformers is presented. The methods proposed in this paper unify terminal models with models derived from the principle of duality between electric and magnetic equivalent circuits. The new model is identified as the terminal-duality model (TDM). The elements of the circuit in addition to properly representing the transformer behavior at the terminals are physically related to flux paths in the transformer window. The circuit of the TDM consists of a set of mutually coupled inductors available in any circuit simulation program and, in particular, available in all Electromagnetic Transients Program-type programs. The circuit elements of the TDM can be computed in two ways: 1) from the observation of the behavior of the magnetic field in the transformer window (applying the principle of duality) and 2) from measurements on short-circuit tests performed at the transformer terminals. Both methods yield identical results. The 2-D finite-element simulations are used to compute the terminal behavior of a wide variety of winding configurations. Several examples are presented for the illustration of the model capabilities and validation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The model is composed of lumped components, it can be seamlessly integrated into system-level simulation of power electronic circuits and achieve good accuracy in time-domain simulation. Taking advantage of the repetitive structure, the model requires very limited number of parameters, which can be easily obtained from the geometry information together with only a few experimental tests.

abstract = {A new, systematic way of coupling low-frequency finite-element (FE) models with circuit systems is proposed using a modified nodal analysis framework. Solid and filamentary conductors can be equally treated as magnetic vector potential-controlled voltage sources. Their matrix contributions to the coupled system are basically the same, leading to a natural way of adding conductors to arbitrary circuit topologies. Algebraic equations of the same type describe the coupling between FE and circuit models, for both massive and filamentary conductors. Any class of independent and dependent source can be considered as well as resistances, inductances, capacitances, transformers, auto-transformers and magnetically-coupled branches. The resulting matrix for the coupled problem is symmetric if the circuit configuration does not contain voltage- or current-controlled sources. The methodology is developed for the general nonlinear time-harmonic problem, but it can be extended to the transient case. An induction motor test case is employed to show the power of the new coupling approach. Comparison of the results against a well-known, validated commercial software (Flux2D) shows that the code developed in this work performs efficiently.},

In some cases, in order to improve the coupling coefficient of a large air-gap transformer, it is interesting to have a low turn number and a large winding window. As a result, coils are composed of a large number of conductors in parallel. Moreover, leakage flux is very important in winding windows. Therefore, losses and current density distribution in coils are not uniform. This paper presents a study of current density distribution and losses in a large air-gap transformer composed of two E cores and two windings using homogenization and 3-D FEM.

Model predictive control requires solving optimization problems in real time, limiting its application to systems with small numbers of switches and a short horizon. We propose a technique for using off-line computation to approximate the model predictive controller. This is done by dividing the planning horizon into two segments, and using a quadratic function to approximate the optimal cost over the second segment. The approximate model predictive algorithm minimizes the true cost over the first segment, and the approximate cost over the second segment, allowing the user to adjust the computational requirements by changing the length of the first segment. We conclude with two simulated examples.},

@article{Dular2006,
abstract = {Purpose – The paper seeks to develop dual 3D finite element (FE) formulations for modeling both inductive and capacitive effects in massive inductors, in particular micro‐coils. The paper aims to build circuit relations relating the voltages and the currents in such inductors to be used in circuit coupling.Design/methodology/approach – A circuit relation involving a unique voltage and complementary inductive and capacitive currents is defined for each inductor. The inductive circuit relation is first classically obtained by a FE magnetodynamic model. Then, the capacitive relation is obtained through a FE electric model, using sources evaluated from the first model. The conformity is defined on one hand for the magnetic flux density and the electric field, and on the other hand for the magnetic field and the electric flux density. Mixed FE, i.e. nodal, edge and face elements, are used to satisfy each chosen conformity level for the unknown fields and to naturally define the involved global quantities, i.e. the voltages, currents and charges.Findings – This contribution points out the interest of satisfying conformity properties for the coupled magnetic and electric problems. An accurate computation of these effects is obtained in the critical frequency range of their strong interaction. In addition, the complementarity of dual solutions gives the possibility to estimate the discretisation error.Originality/value – The mathematical and discretisation tools for any wished conformity level are unified for naturally coupling magnetic and electric problems. The global quantities basis functions involved in the FE circuit relations benefit from a significant support reduction, which facilitates their evaluation and gives them direct physical interpretations.},

As the switching frequency increases and converter size reduced, the core loss will have significant impact to the converter efficiency and temperature. Accurate evaluation is important for magnetic design and converter loss estimation. The classic two-winding method is limited to low frequencies (usually below 1 MHz) because it is sensitive to phase discrepancy. In this paper, a new method is proposed for high-frequency core loss measurement that utilizes capacitive cancellation, which is suitable for HF and VHF core loss measurement. The new method greatly reduces the sensitivity to phase discrepancy, which is the dominating error source in the conventional two-winding method. An experimental demonstration is performed at 10 MHz, and the possible errors are analyzed in detail. With the proposed method, the high-frequency core loss can be accurately measured.},

In many cases, an adequate mapping transforms the problem into an easier one or allows advantage to be taken of the symmetries. This paper demonstrates that any mapping can be handled automatically provided the classical vector analysis approach is given up for the benefit of a differential geometry approach. As a first example, it is shown that axisymmetrical problems need no more a particular treatment provided the mapping of the cylindrical coordinates on the cartesian ones is considered as it is. Furthermore, a novel axisymmetrical formulation is proposed which relies on one further transformation and improves considerably the quality of the interpolated field. Transformation methods are also of great help to model the infinite space by means of finite elements. Many authors have presented such transformations which are often instances of the same general shell transformation that is presented here},

abstract = {A practical approach for magnetic core-loss characterization up to a few megahertz is presented. An error analysis is for the first time performed, revealing that corrections are needed to compensate for errors introduced by the extra phase shift inherent in a measurement setup, and by shunt parasitic capacitance associated with an inductive device under test. A simple technique is then proposed to control the error so as to satisfy prescribed tolerances. Extensive measurements done on a TDK PC40 core yield results which support the analysis. Several sample cores are then characterized at a few megahertz},

The distributed inductances are calculated by using small-signal analysis in finite element method (FEM) and the ac resistances of coils are analyzed considering the skin effect. The distributed capacitances of the coils are determined by using both electric field FEM and analytic equations. The electric potential distribution of inter-turn is calculated by the above two methods. The incident and reflect voltages are calculated by using the MTL model. The electric field of inter-turn calculated by using the FEM is presented. The FEM is used for the calculation of the inter-turn electric field distribution. The position where the inter-turn insulation may be more prone to breakdown is determined according to the result. Finally, the impact factors of inter-turn insulation including insulation materials and positions of failure in winding are analyzed in detail.},

The resulting magnetic field on cut sections of the conductor is used as boundary condition for the partial element equivalent circuit method. Based on the coupling of these methods, power losses on litz wire level have been calculated taking different bundle structures and pitch lengths into account. The work flow has been automatized and enables simulations of litz wire systems with hundreds of strands. For different simulation setups, the simulations have been verified by comparison to measurements up to 500 kHz. The average deviation is less than 5% in the relevant frequency range.},

First, an additional radially-axially oriented FE model deals with the complicated return path of the common-mode current through the laminated core and leads to an additional impedance to be inserted into the TLM. Sec- ondly, an additional TLM section is constructed using parameters extracted from an axisymmetric FE model of the winding overhang. Thereby, the impedance mismatches caused by the end-winding overhangs along the wave propagation direction are incorporated in the model. Thirdly, the capacitive and inductive inter-wire couplings are taken into account. The simulation results indicate the need of all three additions},

Previous work includes a formula based on a parametric set of finite-element analysis (FEA) simulations that gives proximity-effect loss for a large range of frequencies, using the parameters from a lookup table based on winding geometry. We improve the formula by decreasing the number of parameters in the formula and also, more importantly, by using simple functions to get the parameters from winding geometry such that a large lookup table is not needed. The function we present is exact in the low frequency limit (diameter much smaller than skin depth) and has error less than 4% at higher frequencies. We make our new model complete by examining the field expression needed to get the total proximity-effect loss and by including the skin-effect loss. We also present experimental results confirming the validity of the model and its superiority to standard methods.},

abstract = {<p>The complex initial permeability (CIP) as a function of frequency is one of the main properties of ferrites. This characteristic (CIP) is measured experimentally, therefore there can be found noisy, doubtful or incomplete parts of the spectrum. Thus there is a need for a method of evaluation of quality of CIP. In this article for evaluation of the quality of experimental CIP spectra of polycrystalline ferrite materials the KKR (Kramers-Kronig relations) are used. In order to apply KKR to experimentally measured data (i.e. data with finite limits) the method of transforming these integral relations into summation relations with finite limits is developed and described. This method can be used only for CIP given over the wide frequency rage, so that the imaginary part of CIP is fully presented. Using KKR with the help of CIP spectra model (based on the effects coming from polycrystal grain sizes and defects distribution) partly removes aforementioned limit. Thus with the help of the model we can also make CIP spectra reconstruction (in cases when CIP is noisy or incomplete) and CIP spectra decomposition.</p>},

Using stationary frame PR controller to replace PI controller in dq synchronous frame directly leads to analytical errors, especially in low frequency stage. Another straightforward analysis method is to use stationary frame PI controller to replace PI controller in dq synchronous frame, however the coupling terms in dq synchronous frame are ignored and the approximation is not accurate.

abstract = {Many grid connected power electronic systems, such as STATCOMs, UPFCs, and distributed generation system interfaces, use a voltage source inverter (VSI) connected to the supply network through a filter. This filter, typically a series inductance, acts to reduce the switching harmonics entering the distribution network. An alternative filter is a LCL network, which can achieve reduced levels of harmonic distortion at lower switching frequencies and with less inductance, and therefore has potential benefits for higher power applications. However, systems incorporating LCL filters require more complex control strategies and are not commonly presented in literature. This paper proposes a robust strategy for regulating the grid current entering a distribution network from a three-phase VSI system connected via a LCL filter. The strategy integrates an outer loop grid current regulator with inner capacitor current regulation to stabilize the system. A synchronous frame PI current regulation strategy is used for the outer grid current control loop. Linear analysis, simulation, and experimental results are used to verify the stability of the control algorithm across a range of operating conditions. Finally, expressions for ""harmonic impedance" of the system are derived to study the effects of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic performance of the system.},

In this paper we develop a multiscale computational homogenization method for modelling nonlinear multiscale materials in magnetostatics based on the finite element method. The method solves the macroscale problem by getting data from certain microscale problems around some points of interest. The missing nonlinear constitutive law at the macroscale level is derived through an upscaling from the microscale solutions. The downscaling step consists in imposing a source term and determining proper boundary conditions for microscale problems from the macroscale solution.

The bundles have a finite pitch length, and the permutation of strands within this length is not perfect. This paper illustrates the effects of this nonideal construction on skin and proximity losses in the winding and indicates some applications where this may become important. Test setups have been developed to measure skin losses and proximity losses separately, thus offering the possibility of quantifying the quality of real litz wires by comparing the test results with the ideal behavior.},

An analytical modeling of conductor physical behavior was developed to match optimization requirements, and used to compare various components with different cores - coils geometries and wire technologies. Rigorous analytical modeling was applied to achieve minimization of the losses, using homogenization of the stack of wires in equivalent conductive layers of the coils, first introduced by Dowell and improved here. The resolution has been carried out for many different shapes of conductors. All the results are compared to FEM simulations ones and both are analyzed to compare in a quantitative way proximity and skin-depth effects. Then, taking into account the harmonic content of current waveforms, conductor's losses are minimized. It is highlighted that losses could largely be reduced by improvements of coil structure and the choice of conductor's shapes. The benefit of using an optimized design procedure to select best industrial solution has been proven.},

abstract = {Efficient recursive methods and circuits for computing a continuously updated discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of an input-digital signal are considered. The Fourier transform (FT) is recomputed at each sample input time, with only O(N) operations being required to compute the transform, where N is the number of frequency bins. Various window functions are considered for windowing the input-wave form, namely a rectangular window, a triangular window, and an exponential window. The last type of window has not been widely considered in the past, partly due to its asymmetrical shape, and hence nonlinear phase response. Nevertheless, it is shown to have certain advantages in ease of computation and in flexibility. For the exponential window, a circuit that conveniently allows zooming in to particularly interesting parts of the frequency spectrum is shown. By appropriately loading a multiplier storage RAM, arbitrarily fine resolution may be achieved in any part of the spectrum, thus permitting closely adjacent peaks to be distinguished. The general approach is based on the interpretation of the FT as a set of simultaneous bandpass filters. Though these filters are generally finite-impulse-response filters, computational advantages are derived from formulating them as recursive filters},

The sliding DFT provides computational advantages over the traditional DFT or FFT for many applications requiring successive output calculations, especially when only a subset of the DFT output bins are required. Methods for output stabilization as well as time-domain data windowing by means of frequency-domain convolution were also discussed. A modified sliding DFT algorithm, called the sliding Goertzel DFT, was proposed to further reduce the computational workload. We start our sliding DFT discussion by providing a review of the Goertzel algorithm and use its behavior as a yardstick to evaluate the performance of the sliding DFT technique. We examine stability issues regarding the sliding DFT implementation as well as review the process of frequency-domain convolution to accomplish time-domain windowing. Finally, a modified sliding DFT structure is proposed that provides improved computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Grid connected solar inverters are used to feed energy generated by a photovoltaic generator into the mains. High efficiency is a major requirement. Furthermore a low total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output current is needed to comply with regulations. This paper presents the control for a new highly efficient inverter topology. Due to disturbances of the grid voltage and non-linear effects such as dead-time effects in the output stage of the inverter, the output current is distorted, especially when using small output inductors. Furthermore, the investigated inverter is operated with 120deg flat-top modulation to improve efficiency. However, this modulation scheme in combination with an LCL output filter leads to higher THD. As the current distortion is periodic with the grid voltage, a repetitive learning controller can be used to compensate it. In this paper, the design of a vector control including a repetitive controller is outlined. The results of the implementation of the control algorithm on hardware are presented.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. This paper presents a virtual circuit controller (VCC), which provides a systematic structured method to stabilize the resonance of an LCL filter in a grid-connected voltage source converter. The semiconductor switches are controlled to mimic the behaviour of a virtual reference circuit. The properly-damped circuit by a resistor in parallel with a filter capacitor is focused on and selected as the reference circuit. A linear transformation matrix is introduced indicating the resemblance between the physical and virtual circuits, and is employed to map the states between both circuits. Accordingly both analog and digital control laws are systematically computed. The insight into the feedback of the capacitor current and voltage through proportional gains is clarified. While the consequence of the former is conventionally known to emulate a resistor for damping purpose, the latter is newly used to emulate an inductor for adjusting the inner-loop control bandwidth and improving the robustness. A Kalman filter is used to deal with the inherent time delay. The detailed discrete-time state-space model of the complete system is derived. The design example of the proportional current controller is demonstrated. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the damping and the robustness of the system against component-value variations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. This paper presents a structured design method for half-bridge converters with higher-order lossless output filters, focusing on the popular LCL filters. The method builds on the theory of terminated ladder networks and on a control algorithm actively emulating the ladder network's termination. Given a desired transfer function, a normalized ladder network is accordingly synthesized and scaled to meet the physical requirements. The component sizing and the active damping of filter resonances are simultaneously tackled. The associated digital-control architecture for LCL filters is explained. A Kalman observer is employed to deal with the inherent sample delay. An LCL filter is designed based on the proposed method and is experimentally validated with the half-bridge converters operating as active front end. The grid reactive currents are stepped and the results show properly damped responses. The system has good disturbance rejection and is passive according to the simulated input admittance. The robustness of the system is also demonstrated by numerical sensitivity analysis. These excellent characteristics can facilitate the design of the upper-layer or incorporated outer-loop controller, and can enhance the performance of the complete system.},

Given a desired reference transfer function, a normalized ladder network is synthesized and scaled to meet the physical requirements. As such, it simultaneously tackles the design and sizing of the filter, and the active damping of filter resonances. The associated digital-control architecture is also elaborated. The method is applied to designing a 3 rd -order LCL filter, of which the experimental results show properly damped responses.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE and EPE Association. This work deals with a frequency-domain homogenization method for litz-wire bundles embedded in a finite element (FE) model. The approach consists in adopting a frequency-dependent complex reluctivity in the litz-wire bundles and a frequency-dependent complex impedance in the electrical circuit in terms of dimensionless coefficients. The litz-wire bundles become homogeneous conductors which are easy to integrate into a finite element model. The homogenization methods in previous works are also reviewed. The complex permeability achieved with our model is compared to the most accurate expression found in literature. The agreement is very good despite the different elementary cell and condition setting. Moreover, the homogenization method in this paper is validated for both 2-D and 3-D FE calculations with the translational-symmetry transformer model and the axisymmetric inductor model respectively. The reference solutions of those models are computed by finely discretizing each conductor inside the litz-wire bundle. The results of the computed resistance and inductance agree well with those computed by the reference fine model, resulting in less than 3% and 0.05% maximum errors respectively in 2-D FE model, and 4% and 1.8% respectively in 3-D FE model with several times less computational cost.},

A new topology is presented for a discrete-time current controller which damps this resonance, combining deadbeat current control with optimal state-feedback pole assignment. By separating the state feedback gains into deadbeat and damping feedback loops, transient overcurrent protection is realizable while preserving the desired pole locations. Moreover, the controller is shown to be robust to parameter uncertainty in the grid inductance.

First, the basic analysis in the continuous s-domain reveals that the grid-current-feedback active damping forms a virtual impedance across the grid-side inductor, and the use of a high-pass filter with a negative sign shapes the virtual impedance by an RL damper paralleled by a negative inductance. It is further found that such a negative virtual inductance plays a critical role in mitigating the phase lag caused by the time delay in a digital control system. The instability induced by the negative virtual resistance, which is commonly experienced in the feedback-type active damping, can thus be avoided. A systematic design method of the highpass filter is also proposed by the help of root locus analysis in the discrete z-domain. Lastly, experimental tests are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {The work presented in this book offers a general approach to the development of fixed switching frequency pulse width-modulated (PWM) strategies to suit hard-switched converters. It is shown that modulation of, and resulting spectrum for, the half-bridge single-phase inverter forms the basic building block from which the spectral content of modulated single- phase, three-phase, or multiphase, two-level, three-level, or multilevel, voltage link and current link converters can readily be discerned. The concept of harmonic distortion is used as the performance index to compare all commonly encountered modulation algorithms. In particular, total harmonic distortion (THO), weighted total harmonic distortion (WTHD), and harmonic distortion criterion specifically designed to access motor copper losses are used as performance indices. The concept of minimum harmonic distortion, which forms the underlying basis of comparison of the work presented in this book, leads to the identification of the fundamentals ofPWM as Active switch pulse width determination. Active switch pulse placement within a switching period. Active switch pulse sequence across switching periods. The benefit of this generalized approach is that once the common threads of PWM are identified, the selection of a PWM strategy for any converter topology becomes immediately obvious, and the only choices remaining are to trade-off the "best possible" performance against cost and difficulty of implementation, and secondary considerations. Furthermore, the performance to be expected from a particular converter topology and modulation strategy can be quickly and easily identified without complex analysis, so that informed tradeoffs can be made regarding the implementation of a PWM algorithm for any particular application. All theoretical developments have been confirmed either by simulation or experiment. Inverter implementation details have been included at the end of the text to address practical considerations. Readers will probably note the absence of any closed loop issues in this text. While initially such material was intended to be included, it soon became apparent that the inclusion of this material would require an additional volume. A further book treating this subject is in preparation. xiii},

abstract = {Multiloop control strategies have commonly been used to control power inverters of both the voltage-source and current-source topologies for power conversion applications including uninterruptible power supplies and utility interfaces for distributed power generation. However, these control strategies tend to be developed and comparatively evaluated for a particular application, with strategies for other applications presented as independent new developments. This paper presents a generalized analysis of different multiloop control approaches using alternative feedback control variables for several popularly adopted system configurations, highlighting similarities and identifying a generalized optimal control-variable selection criterion that is applicable across most multiloop-controlled inverter systems. The generality of the presented optimal variable selection criterion has been verified through the close similarities between the time-domain waveforms of the different inverter systems simulated in MATLAB Simulink and implemented experimentally in the laboratory.},

Oscillation will occur in the control loop in high frequency ranges, especially in current loop in double-loops controlled converters.

abstract = {In this paper, the closed-loop control of both voltage-source converter (VSC) and current-source converter (CSC) systems with LC filters is investigated, with a focus being put on the damping of LC resonance. First, both single-loop and multiloop control schemes for a voltage-source inverter (VSI) with output LC filter are analyzed, where the design and tuning procedure can also be applied to a current-source inverter (CSI) with output CL filter. It is shown that both VSI and CSI systems are subject to LC resonance, even with multiloop control, while the CSI system is also subject to LC resonant frequency variations. On the other hand, the LC resonant frequencies in both current-source rectifier (CSR) and voltage-source rectifier (VSR) systems with input LC filter circuits are relatively fixed due to the small variation range of source impedance. To further dampen the LC resonance in these converter systems, active damping techniques such as virtual harmonic damper and control-signal-shaping methods are investigated, and their implementation into the converter systems is discussed in detail. Experimental results from both a VSC system and a CSC system are obtained.},

abstract = {In this paper, a generalized closed-loop control (GCC) scheme is proposed for voltage source converters (VSCs) with LC or LCL output filters. The proposed GCC scheme has a single-loop control of inverter output (voltage or current) and two parallel virtual impedance terms using additional measurements. The virtual impedance can be the equivalent internal impedance or external impedance (or both), depending on their control term and feedback variable selection. The internal impedance term is mainly responsible for providing desired damping to the filter circuit, and the external virtual impedance term can effectively adjust the converter system closed-loop output impedance. As each term in the GCC scheme can be controlled independently, the proposed GCC scheme has great flexibility and can easily realize and explain the performances of the traditional single- and multiloop control schemes and their different variations. Moreover, the GCC scheme provides a distinct physical meaning of each control term, which makes the control parameter tuning more straightforward and robust. Additionally, as shown in this paper, the proposed GCC scheme can tackle some traditionally challenging control objectives by avoiding the harmonics filtering or derivative terms. Experimental results from laboratory VSC prototypes are obtained to validate the proposed GCC scheme.},

abstract = {Voltage source converters (VSCs) with LCL filters are attractive in grid-connected applications because they greatly reduce the pollution of the utility voltage due to switching harmonics. However, LCL networks have very low impedance at frequencies close to the resonance, and therefore, even small voltage magnitudes at those frequencies can excite currents of large magnitudes or even cause instability. In this paper, a novel current controller structure is proposed that uses a Luenberger observer as a sensor replacement and state predictor to predict the filter capacitor current which is passed through a virtual resistor to achieve a damping effect. The predicted filter capacitor current through a virtual resistor is the inner fast loop, while the outer loop containing the appropriate feedforward terms ensures fast command tracking and zero steady-state error. The use of the predicted states alleviates the impact of computational and sampling delays which greatly improves the active damping (AD) capability. The proposed solution eliminates the need for additional sensors. This paper presents simulation and experimental results which demonstrate AD and the effectiveness of the virtual resistance in actively stiffening the input impedance of the AFE drive at frequencies close to resonance.},

Filter capacitor current, as well as voltage feedback for the purpose of resonance damping, are analyzed and compared. Basic studies in the continuous Laplace domain show that either proportional current feedback or derivative voltage feedback yields resonance damping. Detailed investigations of these two approaches in the discrete z-domain, taking into account the discrete nature of control implementation, sampling, and PWM, are carried out. Several ratios of LCL resonance frequency and control frequency are considered. At high resonance frequencies, only current feedback stabilizes the system. At medium resonance frequencies, both approaches have good performance. At low resonance frequencies, stability gets worse, even though voltage feedback offers slightly better damping properties.

While many active damping methods have been proposed to overcome this issue, the role that pulse width modulation transport delay plays in the effectiveness of these strategies is still not fully resolved. This paper presents a theoretical discrete time-analysis framework that identifies three distinct regions of LCL filter resonance, namely, a high resonant frequency region where active damping is not required, a critical resonant frequency where a controller cannot stabilize the system, and a low resonant frequency region where active damping is essential. Suitable controllers are then proposed for the two stable regions, with gain calculations that allow for the greatest system bandwidth and damping.

Active resonance damping is state of the art to face the problem, but it is still under investigation because of the manifold solutions. It is often realized using many sensors and/or complex control algorithms. In contrast, pure PI control requires only one set of current sensors, and its implementation and design are rather simple and well known from the L filter control. PI control has already been shown to be a suitable solution also for LCL filters, but there are limitations. These are investigated in this paper. System stability is analyzed with respect to different ratios of LCL filter resonance and control frequencies. The latter are important parameters for system design and control. Both line and converter current control are analyzed. For a certain range of frequency ratios, the voltage-oriented PI control gives stable performance without additional feedback, but for ratios outside this range, stable operation is impossible. Experimental tests validate the theoretical results. In addition, an experimentally determined LCL filter transfer function is shown in this paper, which shows a lower resonance peak as expected from commonly used filter models.},

abstract = {LLCL-filter is an emerging fourth-order filter proposed after the third-order LCL -filter. It uses smaller passive components than the LCL-filter, but is still burdened by resonance complications when used with a grid converter. An LLCL-filtered converter must, hence, be passively or actively damped. Active damping is presently more efficient, and can easily be realized by feeding back a state variable. For the LCL-filter, the variable is usually its middle capacitor current. However, with computational delays considered, a simple proportional damper cannot be used with the capacitor current. Instead, a high-pass damper must be used, which as commonly known, may cause undesired noise complications depending on operating conditions. In this paper, the same capacitor current damper has been investigated for the LLCL -filter with its limitations clarified. Both cases of with and without delays have been considered. The investigation has also been extended to consider the LC-trap voltage feedback, which based on the formulated transfer functions and experimental results, permits a simple proportional damper to be used. Lesser noise complications and faster dynamic can then be achieved. Circuit equivalences for the presented dampers have also been derived, from which quick damping insights can be easily drawn. These equivalences are, therefore, helpful tools to the practicing engineers.},

Based on this model, a very simple program was written on a desk-top computer for the transient analysis of lossy trammission lines. Two examples are presented. The first example is an analysis of the step and pulse responses of a 600-m RG-8/U coaxial cable. The computed results show excellent agreement with measured data. The second example studies the current at the end of a 12-in 7-$\Omega$ strip line under different loading conditions.

The expressions for optimum strand diameter and number of strands at which minimum winding AC resistance is obtained for the litz-wire windings are derived. The boundary frequency between the low-frequency and the medium-frequency ranges are given for both litz-wire and solid-round wire inductors. Hence, the low-frequency ranges of both wire windings are determined. It is shown that litz-wire is better than the solid wire only in specific frequency range. The model has been verified by the measurements, and the theoretical results were in good agreement with those experimentally measured.

For the winding type in hand (e.g., round conductor with hexagonal packing), an elementary FE model is used for determining dimensionless frequency and time-domain coefficients regarding skin and proximity effect. These coefficients are readily utilized for homogenizing the winding in the FE model of the complete device. The method is successfully applied to an axisymmetric 103-turn inductor. The results agree very well with those obtained by an accurate but very expensive FE model in which all turns are finely discretized},

abstract = {The paper is concerned with the optimisation of inductor design to improve the design capability for these large, expensive and heat-producing magnetic components in power electronic circuits. The work focuses on toroidal inductors which consist of uniformly distributed, solid conductor windings on low permeability toroidal cores. It develops methods of calculating the eddy current losses in the windings. The basic analytical equations for losses in the windings are evolved and the problem of variable turn pitch that arises in the toroidal geometry is dealt with by means of an effective core diameter concept. Effective core diameters are presented graphically in terms of normalised parameters. The theoretical and graphical results given in the paper enable toroidal inductor designs to be optimised, and losses to be calculated in a rapid and convenient way. Experimental results are shown to agree well with the theoretical results presented in the paper.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new topology of higher order power filter for grid-tied voltage-source inverters, named the LLCL filter, which inserts a small inductor in the branch loop of the capacitor in the traditional LCL filter to compose a series resonant circuit at the switching frequency. Particularly, it can attenuate the switching-frequency current ripple components much better than an LCL filter, leading to a decrease in the total inductance and volume. Furthermore, by decreasing the inductance of a grid-side inductor, it raises the characteristic resonance frequency, which is beneficial to the inverter system control. The parameter design criteria of the proposed LLCL filter is also introduced. The comparative analysis and discussions regarding the traditional LCL filter and the proposed LLCL filter have been presented and evaluated through experiment on a 1.8-kW-single-phase grid-tied inverter prototype.},

In this paper, the common mode and the differential mode EMI noises are investigated for the LCL- and LLCL-filter-based single-phase full-bridge grid-tied inverters. Based on this, a modified LLCL-filter topology is proposed to provide enough attenuation on the conducted EMI noise as well as to reduce the dc-side leakage current. The parameter design method of the filter is also developed. The comparative analysis and discussion on four filter cases (the conventional LCL filter, the conventional LLCL filter, the modified LCL filter, and the modified LLCL filter) are carried out and verified through simulations and experiments on a 0.5-kW, 110 V/50 Hz single-phase full-bridge grid-tied inverter prototype.},

A main application of inductive components is EMI filters, as, e.g., employed for the attenuation of switching frequency harmonics of power factor correction (PFC) rectifier systems. In this paper, a design procedure for the mains side LCL filter of an active three-phase rectifier is introduced. The procedure is based on a generic optimization approach, which guarantees a low volume and/or low losses. Different designs are calculated to show the tradeoff between filter volume and filter losses. The design procedure is verified by experimental measurements. Furthermore, an overall system optimization, i.e., an optimization of the complete three-phase PFC rectifier, is given.},

Existing empirical approaches still present some limitations such as the inaccuracy and the difficulty to apply under nonsinusoidal waveforms. In particular, these methods fail to predict core loss with low duty cycle and when there is a significant change in the frequency. In addition to that, the use of different solutions of Steinmetz parameters for different frequency range can present some discontinuity problems at the boundary of each frequency interval. The main contribution of this study is to develop a new empirical method to estimate magnetic core losses under nonsinusoidal induction. The developed method is enough accurate and user-friendly to apply by designers. The effects of the frequency and the duty cycle are considered. The developed model is verified and compared with the improved generalized Steinmetz equation and measurement data from literature with 3F3 and N67 ferrite materials.},

abstract = {The increased efficiency and quality constraints imposed on electrical energy systems have inspired a renewed research interest in the study of formal approaches to the analysis and control of power electronics converters. Switched systems represent a useful framework for modeling these converters and the peculiarities of their operating conditions and control goals justify the specific classification of “switched electronic systems”. Indeed, idealized switched models of power converters introduce problems not commonly encountered when analyzing generic switched models or non-switched electrical networks. In that sense the analysis of switched electronic systems represents a source for new ideas and benchmarks for switched and hybrid systems generally. Dynamics and Control of Switched Electronic Systems draws on the expertise of an international group of expert contributors to give an overview of recent advances in the modeling, simulation and control of switched electronic systems. The reader is provided with a well-organized source of references and a mathematically-based report of the state of the art in analysis and design techniques for switched power converters. Intuitive language, realistic illustrative examples and numerical simulations help the reader to come to grips with the rigorous presentation of many promising directions of research such as: converter topologies and modulation techniques; continuous-time, discrete-time and hybrid models; modern control strategies for power converters; and challenges in numerical simulation. The guidance and information imparted in this text will be appreciated by engineers, and applied mathematicians working on system and circuit theory, control systems development, and electronic and energy conversion systems design. Advances in Industrial Control aims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of new work in all aspects of industrial control.},

abstract = {An LLCL-filter is becoming more attractive than an LCL-filter as the interface between the grid-tied inverter and the grid due to possibility of reducing the copper and the magnetic materials. The efficiency of the LLCL-filter based single-phase grid-tied inverter also excites interests for many applications. The operation of the switches of the VSI is various with different modulation methods, which lead to different efficiencies for such a single-phase grid-tied inverter system, and therefore important research has been carried out on the effect of the choice of PWM schemes. Then power losses and efficiencies of the LLCL-filter and the LCL-filter based single-phase grid-tied inverters are analyzed and compared under the discontinuous unipolar, the dual-buck and the bipolar modulations. Results show that the efficiency of LLCL-filter based inverter system is higher than the LCL- filter based independent on the modulation method adopted. Experiments on a 2 kW prototype are in good agreement with results of the theoretical analysis},

abstract = {IEEE In order to prevent the power switching devices (e.g., the Insulated-Gate-Bipolar-Transistor, IGBT) from shoot-through in voltage source converters during a switching period, the dead time is added either in the hardware driver circuits of the IGBTs or implemented in the software Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) scheme. Both solutions will contribute to a degradation of the injected current power quality. As a consequence, the harmonics induced by the dead time (referred to as "dead time harmonics" hereafter) have to be compensated in order to achieve a satisfactory current as required by the standards. In this paper, the emission mechanism of dead time harmonics in single-phase PWM inverters is presented considering the modulation schemes in details. More importantly, a repetitive controller has been adopted to eliminate the dead time effect in single-phase grid-connected PWM converters. The repetitive controller has been plugged into a proportional resonant based fundamental current controller so as to mitigate the dead time harmonics and also maintain the control of the fundamental grid current in terms of dynamics. Simulations and experiments are provided, which confirm that the repetitive controller can effectively compensate the dead time harmonics and other low-order distortions, and also it is a simple method without hardware modifications.},

abstract = {FILM CAPACITORS Plastic film capacitors are generally subdivided into film/foil capacitors and metalized film capacitors. FILM / FOIL CAPACITORS Film / foil capacitors basically consist of two metal foil electrodes that are separated by an insulating plastic film also called dielectric. The terminals are connected to the end-faces of the electrodes by means of welding or soldering. Main features: High insulation resistance, excellent current carrying and pulse handling capability and a good capacitance stability. METALIZED FILM CAPACITORS The electrodes of metalized film capacitors consist of an extremely thin metal layer (0.02 $\mu$m to 0.1 $\mu$m) that is vacuum deposited either onto the dielectric film or onto a carrier film. The opposing and extended metalized film layers of the wound capacitor element are connected to one another by flame spraying different metals to the end-faces. The metal spraying process is also known as schooping. The terminals are connected to the end-faces by means of welding or soldering. For the production of metalized film capacitors Vishay film capacitors uses the conventionally wound film. Main features: High volume efficiency, self-healing properties SPECIAL DESIGN CAPACITORS For high current applications Vishay film capacitors is also able to offer special designs such as capacitors with a heavy edge metalization or a double sided metalization as well as combinations that have a film/foil and a metalized film design in one unit. For high voltage applications it is furthermore possible to offer designs with dual and multiple sections. Depending on the design these capacitors provide low losses, high current and pulse carrying capabilities, high voltages, small dimensions and good self-healing properties. RFI SUPPRESSION CAPACITORS There are two main sources of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). Devices that due to their construction produce RF energy, such as oscillators, radio and TV receivers; and devices that produce a wide spectrum of frequency, due to rapid variations in electrical current intensity, such as switch mode power supplies. Interference from source to receiver is spread in three ways: • Along wiring • By coupling • By radiation RFI suppression capacitors are the most effective way to reduce RF energy interference. As its impedance decrease with frequency, it acts as a short-circuit for high-frequencies between the mains terminals and/or between the mains terminals and the ground. Capacitors for applications between the mains terminals are called X Class capacitors. Capacitors for applications between the terminals and the ground are called Y Class capacitors. X-Capacitors For the suppression of symmetrical interference voltage. Capacitors with unlimited capacitance for use where their failure will not lead to the danger of electrical shock on human beings and animals. The capacitor must present a safe end of life behavior. Y-Capacitors Capacitors for suppression of asymmetrical interference voltage, and are located between a live wire and a metal case which may be touched. High electrical and mechanical reliability to prevent short-circuits in the capacitors. The capacitance value is limited, in order to reduce the AC current flowing through the capacitor. By following these technical requirements, it is intended that its failure will not lead to the risk of electrical shock, making the device with Y capacitor (in conjunction with other protective measures) safe to human beings and animals. For detailed information, we refer to www.vishay.com/doc?28153. SELF-HEALING Self-healing, also known as clearing, is the removal of a defect caused by pinholes, film flaws or external voltage transients. The heat generated by the arcing during a breakdown, evaporates the extremely thin metalization of the film around the point of failure, thereby removing and isolating the short circuit conditions. On Segmented Film Technology Capacitors, the self healing effect is more controlled. The film metalization is made by forming a pattern of segments, which are connected to each other by micro fuses. This limits the healing current and limits the self-healing effect to a well defined section of the film. The self-healing process requires only $\mu$W of power and a defect is normally isolated in less than 10 $\mu$s. Extensive and continuous self-healing (e.g. at misapplications) will gradually decrease the capacitance value.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the influence of nonsinusoidal flux waveforms on the remagnetization losses in ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials of inductors, transformers, and electrical machines used in power electronic applications. The nonsinusoidal changes of flux originate from driving these devices by nonsinusoidal voltages and currents at different switching frequencies. A detailed examination of a dynamic hysteresis model shows that the physical origin of losses in magnetic material is the average rate of remagnetization rather than the remagnetization frequency. This principle leads to a modification of the most common calculation rule for magnetic core losses, i.e., to the “modified Steinmetz equation” (MSE). In the MSE, the remagnetization frequency is replaced by an equivalent frequency which is calculated from the average remagnetization rate. This approach allows, for the first time, the calculation of the losses in the time domain for arbitrary waveforms of flux while using the available set of parameters of the classical Steinmetz equation. DC premagnetization of the material, having a substantial influence on the losses, can also be included. Extensive measurements verify the MSE presented in this paper},

It makes a good trade-off between resonant control and repetitive control: A parallel combination of multiple resonant controllers can track/eliminate selective harmonic frequencies very fast, but cause heavy parallel computation; a repetitive controller that is in compact recursive form can achieve zero tracking error at all harmonic frequencies, but yields slow convergence rates at selective harmonic frequencies.

abstract = {The large-scale integration of power electronic based systems poses new challenges to the stability and power quality of modern power grids. The wide timescale and frequency-coupling dynamics of electronic power converters tend to bring in harmonic instability in the form of resonances or abnormal harmonics in a wide frequency range. This paper provides a systematic analysis of harmonic stability in the future power-electronic-based power systems. The basic concept and phenomena of harmonic stability are elaborated first. It is pointed out that the harmonic stability is a breed of small-signal stability problems, featuring the waveform distortions at the frequencies above and below the fundamental frequency of the system. The linearized models of converters and system analysis methods are then discussed. It reveals that the linearized models of ac-dc converters can be generalized to the harmonic transfer function, which is mathematically derived from linear time-periodic system theory. Lastly, future challenges on the system modeling and analysis of harmonic stability in large-scale power electronic based power grids are summarized.},

abstract = {LCL filters have been widely used for grid-connected inverters. However, the problem that how time delay affects the stability of digitally controlled grid-connected inverters with LCL filters has not been fully studied. In this paper, a systematic study is carried out on the relationship between the time delay and stability of single-loop controlled grid-connected inverters that employ inverter current feedback (ICF) or grid current feedback (GCF). The ranges of time delay for system stability are analyzed and deduced in the continuous s-domain and discrete z-domain. It is shown that in the optimal range, the existence of time delay weakens the stability of the ICF loop, whereas a proper time delay is required for the GCF loop. The present work explains, for the first time, why different conclusions on the stability of ICF loop and GCF loop have been drawn in previous studies. To improve system stability, a linear predictor-based time delay reduction method is proposed for ICF, while a time delay addition method is used for GCF. A controller design method is then presented that guarantees adequate stability margins. The delay-dependent stability study is verified by simulation and experiment.},
